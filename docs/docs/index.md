## Overview

Welcome to the Rinkhals project documentation!

Rinkhals is a custom firmware overlay for the Anycubic Kobra series of 3D printers. It supports Kobra 3, Kobra 3 Max, Kobra S1 and some Kobra 2 Pro 3D printers.
This documentation covers what we know about those printers, what we know about Anycubic software, Rinkhals and some high levels guides to achieve specific things.
